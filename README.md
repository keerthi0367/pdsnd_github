# Bikeshare Project


## Description
Hi,
This project is designed to explore and analyze US bikeshare data for three major cities: **Chicago, New York City, and Washington**.  
The program allows the user to filter data by **city, month, and day of the week**, and it calculates and displays statistics on:

- Most frequent times of travel
- Most popular stations and trips
- Trip durations
- Bikeshare user information (user types, gender, birth year)
- Optionally displays raw data 5 rows at a time
- 
This project is implemented in **Python** and uses the **pandas** and **numpy** libraries for data manipulation and analysis.


## Files Used
- `bikeshare.py` — main Python script that runs the program and performs analysis  
- `chicago.csv` — dataset for Chicago bikeshare  
- `new_york_city.csv` — dataset for New York City bikeshare  
- `washington.csv` — dataset for Washington bikeshare  


## Usage
1. Run the script `bikeshare.py` in Python 3.
2. Follow the prompts to select a **city**, **month**, and **day**.
3. View the calculated statistics.
4. Optionally, choose to display raw data 5 rows at a time.
5. Restart the analysis if needed.
